A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.”,0
[The 1990 IPCC report said] that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable,0
Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods,1
"In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves.",1
The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C),0
global temperatures have risen between 0.23F (0.13C) and 0.34F (0.19C) per decade,0
However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast,0
In 1990 the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F (0.3C) per decade.,1
"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010.",1
But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.,0
"at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.",0
"But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour, which makes 95 per cent of the total.",1
"CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.",0
it’s virtually impossible to get funded for work that disputes climate change through other channels [other than oil companies],1
One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age.,1
"The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today",1
But the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming.,1
in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC – Jonathan Overpeck – wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’,0
"it later emerged that its creator Dr Michael Mann had spliced too [sic] datasets together – tree-rings showing temperatures going back hundreds of years, then recent thermometer readings for the more recent decades.",1

until temperature increases began to slow down after 1998 and remained relatively stable for a period of 15 years,1
"In one particularly damning email, CRU director Phil Jones said he had used ‘Mike’s Nature trick’ to ‘hide the decline’ in temperatures in the second half of the 20th century.",1
"In an interview with the BBC after the scandal broke, Dr Jones admitted there had been no statistically significant global warming since 1995",0
The panel was forced to retract a statement in its 2007 report saying all Himalayan glaciers could melt entirely by 2035.,1
The figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed.,0
"Climate skeptics argue temperature records have been adjusted in recent years to make the past appear cooler and the present warmer, although the Carbon Brief showed that NOAA has actually made the past warmer, evening out the difference.",0
"When the measuring equipment gets old and needs replacing, it often requires re-calibration.",1
A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message.,1
The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.,1
Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.,0
"In addition, [climate models] ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial",0
There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] floods,0
There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] droughts,0
"For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests",1
"[data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter",1
"there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,",0
Let’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be.,0
the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed,0
"Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.",0
"Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.",0
"The first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated, by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships’ water intake.",1
"But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder, which increases the warming trend.",0
"Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often, and darker stations absorb more of the sun’s energy.",1
"Last month was the hottest June ever recorded, European satellite agency announces",0
"temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.",0
"Rapid assessment of average temperatures in France between 26-28 June showed a “substantial” increase in the likelihood of the heatwave happening as a result of human-caused global warming, experts at the World Weather Attribution group said.",0
"Heatwaves occur in any climate, but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change.",1
"While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story",1
"They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms, that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases, and that they didn’t expect that situation to change in the near future.",0
"Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods.",0
There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S.,0
Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally.,0
"Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase.",0
"And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.",0
The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather,0
"This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities, as learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks.",1
"With that in mind, they propose a plausible and terrifying “2050 scenario” whereby humanity could face irreversible collapse in just three decades.",0
Their analysis calculates the existential climate-related security risk to Earth through a scenario set 30 years into the future.,0
"North America suffers extreme weather events including wildfires, drought, and heatwaves.",1
"Monsoons in China fail, the great rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls by half.",0
"The knock-on consequences affect national security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic disease outbreaks, are overwhelming.",1
"Armed conflicts over resources may become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war.",0
The most recent IPCC report lays out a future if we limit global heating to 1.5°C instead of the Paris Agreement’s 2°C.,0
By 2050 there’s a scientific consensus that we reached the tipping point for ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic,1
"Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes.",1
"when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.",0
"whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.",0
"If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.",0
"for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion.",1
[subsidies for wind and solar] add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine.,0
The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives.,0
"“As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable.",0
"Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",0
We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit.,0
"there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.",0
a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming,0
nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.,1
Climate Change ‘Heat Records’ Are a Huge Data Manipulation,1
The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.,0
"On Feb. 7, several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record.",1
Actual weather records over the past 100 years show no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.,0
"as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.",0
From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement.,0
"However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase.",0
"describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040",1
"But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.",1
"International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.”",0
"Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world",0
Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing.,0
"“But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing.",0
Climate scientists use the 20th-century average as a benchmark for global temperature measurements.,0
It’s also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability.,0
NOAA’s analysis found last month was the 3rd-warmest April on record globally.,0
"The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.",1
"For the year-to-date, the Earth is seeing its 5th-warmest start to the year.",0
There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of Global Warming,0
"“Today climate scientists are obsessed with the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a very very small part of the overall picture.",0
Carbon dioxide is a trace gas.”,1
"It’s not carbon dioxide, it’s not methane… Scientists estimate that somewhere between 75% and 90% of Earth greenhouse effect is caused by water vapor in clouds.”",0
"“Every day, nature puts twenty times as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of Earth industries.",1
"So it’s clear now we’re not seeing dangerous global warming, and the climate models are wrong.",0
If we double atmospheric carbon dioxide[…] we’d only raise global surface temperatures by about a degree Celsius.,0
The idea that the much smaller carbon dioxide cycle is now controlling the water cycle is not very likely.,0
"“So the bottom line of all this is that climate change is natural, not man-made.",0
Man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.”,0
Climate scientists are telling us it’s likely we’re going to be in for a period of cooling.,0
"temperatures rise and they fall, and they rise and they fall… and for the last 400 years we’ve had a gentle warming as we’ve been coming out of the little ice age.",0
"Temperatures cooled from about 1940 to 1975, and then they rose from about ’75 to about 2005 or so, and since then they’ve been flat or cooling.",0
“So now we’re able to explain from natural factors how we’ve had the 20th Century warming.,0
"This is the South Pole ice, 90% of Earth’s ice, and it’s getting thicker.",0
"Ocean levels have been rising for the last 20,000 years[…] No climate scientist can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man-made sea level rise began.",0
"According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average.",0
"La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific",0
"Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic.",1
Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions,1
Protecting and restoring forests would reduce 18% of emissions by 2030,0
"It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests.",1
"“We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.",0
“It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change.,0
Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”,1
IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments,1
"But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns",0
"Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.",0
"The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm, with up to a 20-foot storm surge.",0
"While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore, it happened again there in 1675, with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm.",0
"Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought, a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event.",0
The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time.,0
"The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades, but that is due to increasing population, wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure.",0
"But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.”",0
"“During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.",1
"More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.",0
Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic,0
water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate,0
"For the past 4567 million years, the sun and the Earth’s orbit have driven climate change cycles.",1
"Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale",1
Just 1.25 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-ocean system has been released by ­humans in the past 250 years.,0
Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres,0
Our evolving dynamic planet has survived[…] mass extinctions,1
South Australia is winning: it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity.,1
"When South Australians buy electricity at $14,200/MWh, they are paying the equivalent of $400 a litre for petrol.",0
Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save.,0
Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state,1
"Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25°C, forest dieback will add 0.11°C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9°C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02°C.",1
"We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said.",1
The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,1
"The jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems.",1
The extent of climate change’s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research.,1
"Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit.",1
Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate.,1
The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme.,1
"In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.",0
The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be.,0
Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists.,1
"And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.",1
current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two,1
This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.,1
"In looking at Earth’s past, scientists can predict what the future will look like",0
But as the change gets larger or more persistent … it appears they underestimate climate change,0
The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.,1
"While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.",1
"‘Summers keep getting hotter,’ said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.",1
‘Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.,1
"‘If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.’",1
the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm,1
"On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.",0
"But despite [the Gulf Stream], the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.",1
"The sun was so intense, it took the mercury up to in excess of 120°F as it topped out at 122.4 °F (50.2°C).",0
"Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees.",0
"But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.",0
"It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees.",0
"If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised.",0
Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today,0
"That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”",1
"The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery.",1
"If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier, as scientists anticipate, year-to-year recovery will become more difficult.",1
The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times,1
"Last year, though, was a wet one on the Rio Grande, with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016-17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs.",1
"Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.",1
"Dr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact, too, with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear.",0
"A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.",0
The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”,0
"I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.",0
"The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.",1
as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted,0
"I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice.",1
"Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2.",0
But there is also good data showing sea levels,0
By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so—a far cry from Al Gore’s alarming numbers,1
Mr. Singer is a professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia.,1
"Some experts think we’re on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which would cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius",0
an individual heatwave triggering coral bleaching cannot be linked to global warming as the process triggering an individual heatwave is fundamentally different from that triggering global warming,1

"“Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen.",0
"Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”",0
"“For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet.",0
"many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing",0
"while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.",0
The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction.,0
"Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.",1
"Sea level rise of 65 centimeters, or roughly 2 feet would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world.",1

"“Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat.",0
"In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.”",1

"“The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,’ said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.",0

climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere,1
"While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations, few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves.",1
"A recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot, the ‘overestimation’ was ‘partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.’",0
"While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend",1
"“‘Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend,’ Christy said.",0
"‘While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend.",1
"If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset, they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers, or a long-term cooling,’ Christy said.”",1

"With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago",0
"“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings.",0
"Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.",0
Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates,1
"“‘If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,’ says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.",1
A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries.,0
"The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate”",1
But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.,0
The new research showed that [oxygen isotopes in foraminifera] can change,1
The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells isn’t a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway.,0
"“To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long.",0
"For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time”",0

"Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm",0
“Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense.,1
"In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed.",0
The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.,0
But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.,1
"Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.",1
‘Clean coal’ is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.,1
Climate Models Have Overestimated Global Warming,0
the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’,1
"The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the ‘slowdown’ in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 ‘emissions budget’ for the coming decades.",0
that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was ‘generally smaller than trends estimated’ from the models.”,1
"The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming ‘hiatus’ in the beginning of the 21st century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases…",0
"The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts.",1
"Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.”",0
the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.,1
"In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible.",0
But [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.,1
The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,0
Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet,1

"“The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere).",1
